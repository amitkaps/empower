Respecting Disgust
==================
                    
	I have good news and I have bad news. 
	The bad news is that we have lost the key to the door 
	behind which the secret of life is hidden. 
	The good news is that the door is not locked!

The other day I was walking towards my car in my apartment complex, when I saw a mother with her four year old son walk out of another block all set to catch the bus to go to school. Suddenly the child started puking right on the steps in front of the building. The mother, for some reason, got rather agitated with this and started retorting, “Oh shit! …. Oh Shit! “What are you doing? Oh Shit!” The child simply kept on vomiting and the mother kept on showing her disgust by repeating “Oh shit”. Finally she even snapped, “What did you have today? (as if somebody else had served him breakfast!). 

My first reaction was “What kind of mother is she?’ and a desire to reach out to the child and comfort him. But having learned not to interfere in other’s business, I just walked on pondering over the whole incidence. 

How often we react to what we see (or is visible) – and what we see can often be disgusting - the vomit. However, what was visible was neither the cause, nor the real area of concern. It was churning inside his stomach that was the real trouble. The puke needed no response, but the feeling he was having in the stomach was what needed to be addressed.

So this is what is happening here: 

Visible: Disgusting Behavior - Response: Caustic Reaction 

But if we add a third dimension here – see how the response changes 

Reason: Child’s feelings - Visible: Disgusting Behavior - Response: Empathetic Respect 

Many of us will say, “I will never respond like this mother did. So, let’s take some more examples of disgusting behavior to check out our pattern of response: 

- Small child pulls sister’s hair - how do you respond? 

- Young Teenager says, “That uncle is so horrible” - how do you respond? 

- In his temper a six year old smashes his toy on the floor - how do you respond? 

- A ten year old says, “I hate this homework” - how do you respond? 

- Your middle school daughter says about her friend, “She is such a pig” - how do   you respond? 

Do we want our children to grow up as emotionally balanced individuals? Do we agree that being emotionally balanced is important to lead a successful happy life? 

In which case, first of all, are we exhibiting an emotionally balanced response? Two and more importantly, are we respecting their emotional being, the feelings within? Three, are we emotionally empowering them by showing them how to manage their feelings.

Somewhere our own emotional immaturity first shows up (just like the mothers response to puking). More importantly, by discounting the child's feelings we are leading the child to disregard himself, to loads of negative self talk, suppressing emotions, blaming others, and having no clue how to handle these emotions. 

What we really need is to empower the child emotionally. And the mantra is: 

"Respecting Feelings" 

The premise is that when children’s feelings are respected, they learn to respect their feelings; When they learn to respect their feelings, they start to respect themselves; when they start to respect themselves, they start to respect others; when they respect others, they also respect other’s feelings, they understand, they empathize, they care. 

Here is how we do it:

Look at it in this way – no matter how the child feels, it’s alright to feel that way. It’s only how the child expresses those feelings that could be a problem. Which means the child is justified to feel the way he or she feels, there is nothing right or wrong about the feelings per se. So the first level is accepting the feelings – “You’re not feeling alright”.
 
If we are able to understand the feelings – we might be able to deal with them better. So the second level is to help the child understand his feelings – we do this by identifying the feelings – (What exactly is the child feeling) – He seems to be ‘upset’.
 
The third and the crucial step is to now to respect that feeling – its alright to feel the way you feel – so we acknowledge the child’s feelings by communicating – “You look upset” By respecting the child’s feelings this way we are respecting the child’s innermost persona, the core from where the child operates, the heart. 
 
By respecting the child’s feelings this way we are respecting the child’s innermost persona, the core from where the child operates, the heart.

Lets look at the responses to above situations as examples, before we discuss the benefits of the doing so.

Small child pulls sister’s hair -“You are angry with your sister”

Young Teenager says, “That uncle is so horrible” - “In some way that Uncle has upset you” 

In his temper a six year old smashes his toy on the floor - “You are very angry over something” 

A ten year old says, “I hate this homework” - “Homework seems uninteresting” 
Your middle school daughter says about her friend, “She is such a pig” - You must be really disturbed (with your friend) 
 
Notice the following: 

While we know the behavior shown may not be acceptable, we do not admonish the behavior as of now. As Daniel Goleman (the authority on emotional Intelligence) said, "self awareness has to come before self regulation". Hence we focus on the feelings. Too many children have their feelings discounted and yet we expect them to regulate their feelings! We do not ask a question - a question at this stage is an interrogation. Why are your angry? Or why are you vomiting? :-) Or what are you doing? All seem to focus on behavior and questions its validity. Another problem with questions is that - it is so easy to justify the behavior - "She pushed me so I am pulling her hair?" Instead we merely acknowledge the feelings through a statement. 
 
And what do we gain by respecting the child's emotions: 

One, the child feels better, which brings down the emotion, which brings down the behavior (isn't that what we wanted in the first place). 

Two, the child feels understood (because the child's feelings are respected) 

Three, the child feels valued (because the child is understood) 

Four, the child opens up, talks willingly about 'what happened' and may even propose how he can handle it! 

Five, the child learns how to express his or her feelings more appropriately (so next time chances are instead of smashing the toy, the child will say "I am very angry" 

Lastly, the child starts to own the feelings, and taking responsibility of one's feelings - this according to Daniel Goleman is the second step towards self regulation and emotional empowerment. 

In today's global world emotional Intelligence matters more than Intelligence quotient for success in work, relationship and happiness. Instead of becoming a behavior policeman, can we first become an emotional nurse!

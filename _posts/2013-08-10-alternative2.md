Situation 1 - What would you do if your 7-year-old snatched away the toy from your 1-year-old and left him crying?

Situation 2 - What would you do if your 13-year-old has spilt his coke all over your car seat in spite of your warning him to have it outside the car?

Situation 3 - What would you do if your 3-year-old threw all her clothes outside her cupboard because you said no to her for wearing a certain dress?

An almost unanimous response we get from parents is Teach him / her lesson!

I believe that our intentions behind such an action point are perfect. We want the child to know that this kind of behavior is not acceptable and often leads to undesirable results. We want that child should not repeat this kind of behavior. (Any others?)

A punishment can be seen as a parent deliberately depriving child or inflicting pain upon him in order to teach the child a lesson. Consequences on the other hand let the child realize, accept and think future action based on the natural fallout of his action.

Lets look at this three-step process:

1) Express your feelings strongly - without attacking the character.(Behavior is not acceptable)

2) State your expectations. (What is desirable)

3) Let them make amends through some action - offer choices if required.
(Do THIS so THAT is not repeated).

Situation 1

1) I'm furious! The baby was playing happily until the toy was taken away.It annoys me when somebody's peace is disturbed.

2) I expect you to take care of your younger sister. I expect you two to play with each other, not against each other.

3) It would be proper if find some way to end her crying now. It’s important that both of you are laughing and enjoying.

Situation 2

1) Whole seat has become terribly soiled. It makes me so angry to see this mess. It is even more frustrating to me when you know coke has to be had outside.

2) I expect everybody who rides in the car to take care of the car. I also expect us to be careful while having a drink.

3) The seat needs immediate cleaning. In addition, as soon we reach home, the seat cover needs to be shampooed.

Situation 3

1) I am quite upset the way you reacted to my saying ‘no’. It troubles me when people show their anger by actions.

2) I expect that you will tell me if you are angry. Also, I expect you to first understand my point of view before getting angry.

3) You can put all your clothes back nicely. Alternatively you can first talk to me about your anger then maybe I will help you and we can decorate the cupboard nicely.

Please re-read the last situation. What a lovely way to imbibe this critical life skill – of being able to manage our emotions. If you feel three year olds are too young, try it and you will be surprised - they are very perceptive even at this age.

The simple but extremely effective three step process in so versatile, it can suit any type of discipline problem, any age and any number of children (teachers try it!).

One final word of caution from Dr. Selma Frailberg from her book ‘The Magic Years’: “A child needs to feel our disapproval at certain times, but if our reaction is of such strength (eg: punishment) that the child feels worthless and despised for his offense, we have abused our power as parents and have created the possibility that exaggerated guilt feelings and self hatred will play a part in the child’s development.” 

It is our innate desire to hold power. When we feel powerless in an organization, we withhold information useful to the hierarchy. It’s our way of experiencing power.
The way we can reduce discipline problems is by understanding that most confrontations, most ‘No’s are “power games”. The way to “win” the power game is to give away enough power so that others do not want to take it from you. When you empower children they do not have to compete with you for power.

Simple yet effective! Let’s see how:

Agreement

1. A Harmonious accord on a course of action.

2. An arrangement that is accepted by all parties to a common code or plan of behavior. 
Agreements are based on participation, understanding and acceptance. Once children have understood the reasoning, they will not test your boundaries continuously. Even if they do, normally a reminder suffices.

1) Time based Agreements

Perhaps the most important. When will the child do what? They agree to their timings for various things like play, homework, outdoor activities, TV dinner, sleep time etc. (If required, for younger children, buy a large clock and paste stickers/ labels at appropriate small hand positions). Insist that each agree to arrange circumstances so that they are on time. Become a role model yourself.

2) Safety related Agreements

Discus with lots of reasoning what is unsafe and why. Educate them what age will be safe for them. Agree on different measures both of you will take towards safety and even emergency. Few parents work out emergency drills with children like fire and burn, choking etc.

3) Respect for people, plants, animals and things

This includes a wide spectrum – language, courtesy, handling and care. Use broad agreements and show them through role modeling. Respect them and their material. A parent told me that they had agreed that whenever someone feels like hitting another, they would grab a cushion, a bag or anything soft, keep it next to the person and hit that instead of the person.

4) Learning & School:

If parent’s expectations are clear and child’s efforts are agreed to, most learning can be fun. Similarly standards of learning, scoring marks and behavior to be maintained at school, if agreed, leads to simpler handling of all school related disciplinary issues. Also agree that all will learn from mistakes, which gives you a chance to excuse yourself, while teaches a child that a mistake is not something bad, just an opportunity upside-down

5) Agree to speak for only “I”:

Singularly most effective in avoiding conflicts. Everybody agrees to use only “I” messages - start every sentence with “I”.

Which means you cannot verbally attack another person, complain another person’s behavior or judge or blame another person. So you cannot say, “That child is so stupid”. Instead you have to say, “I don’t like him” or “I will not work with him” etc.


A power struggle situation means time for an agreement. So when a problem occurs lets look at it as an opportunity for growth.
* Let's anticipate a positive outcome and visualize a successful resolution for both parties.
* Let's not get confrontational. The bigger the deal we make, the more we loose. Some children become expert in provoking your standard emotional response. However, a power struggle is not a time to win or ‘nail’ someone. Its time to get the job done with minimum fanfare.
* Let's state only the facts and eschew any judgments (that is agreement no 5 anyway). So no “You make me mad”; instead, “I am feeling really angry”.
Let’s also accept that we cannot have a 100% conflict free home. But we need to use our resources to create a well-balanced environment, where children manage themselves, which is the ultimate in disciplining. Prevention sure is better than cure!

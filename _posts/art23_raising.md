Raising Successful Children - Self Belief
=========================================
                    
The other day I went to a restaurant and ordered a sizzler. Somehow Iattacked the baked tomato first and realized it was only half cooked. Icalled the waiter and showed him the tomato and he very casually pointed out- "But Sir, the rest of the platter is fine.At that moment, I was furious.

It was the first gift that my six year old had wrapped herself. I saw therewas this one fold that was sticking out. When I pointed out to her, shesaid, "Isn't the rest fine, papa?"

It was then I realized what message the waiter had for me. We focus so muchon the 10% imperfection that we forget to appreciate and get encouraged bythe 90% 'perfection'.I also realized that as an adult we often berate our self - especially forthese 20% imperfections that we all have. For many of us, our self talk israrely self appreciative, rather mostly critical of ourselves. We almostthink that it is not nice to feel good about oneself (that should come fromsomebody else). And we carry on with our own abusive self talk.

Digging deeper into the psychology texts I found out that most selfcriticizing habits are formed within the first eight years of life -especially between 2-8 years. Physiologists explain that this is the periodwhen all our negatives are quickly pointed out by adults. To quote PeggyJenkins (from 'The Joyful child'): "Overheard criticisms, put-downs, misinterpretations of parental anger or scolding can all chip away at thechild's self worth and leave him feeling joyless and worthless."

It becomes better after 10 years because increasingly available andimportant PEER evaluation is far more appreciative and less critical. Butthe damage is already done and while the child may not get so many externalput downs, the negative self talk is enough. It’s enough to stop the childfrom dreaming big enough, aiming high enough and trying enough! Its enoughto weaken our overall self esteem. And the vicious thinking assures thatevery failure gets added as proof to our over critical self's repertoire.Here are five parenting tendencies that are chief in doing so. Check themout and see which you are doing and which you need to avoid - at all cost:

1. no, No, NO!

If what the child gets during the day is, "Don't touch this, don't eat this,don't waste your time, don't do like this, no pulling my hair, no playingwith your hair, don't run, no jumping on sofa, don't eat fast, don't eat so slowly..

When our actions get negated, out thoughts gets negated and we start feelingthat "I am not worthy (and capable) of thinking 'right'". To the extent thatoften children will do some actions just to see how soon they are stoppedfrom doing so. They have learned what gets their parents attention. But thereal damage is far deeper.Alternate approach: Try saying YES. Rather then saying what you want thechild NOT to do, try saying what you want the child to do. Eg: Instead of"don't waste your time", say "its nice to focus on your work". Instead of"No, no pulling hair", say "Yes, rub my cheeks, Ahaaaa" etc.

2. Comparison

"Look at how she is eating properly; your sister has already finished herhomework; your friend is playing and having fun, why can't you? See they areall going to school smilingly"; and so on.What you think and feel is less important, what is socially appropriateshould always be done! - While this seems to be least effective kind ofmotivation, I guess as parents we run short of ideas and just tend to use itso frequently that it becomes the bases of all my decision in life.Right from I too want that kind of cycle to when the adult grows and wants acar like the neighbor's big car! But the damage is more than materialistic- it’s when I feel I am incapable or not worthy just because somebody elseseems to be more capable and worthy - then we live a life of low selfesteem. Then we also do not achieve much because we think we're unworthy ofachieving much!Alternate approach: Understand motivation. Focus on progress of your childrather then comparative performance.

3. Blame

I remember when I had got that sizzler in the restaurant with half cookedtomato the first thought that came to my mind was "these guys are horrible".Now I realize - the guys were not horrible, only the tomato was. Haven'teach one of us done some things wrong - does that make us horrible or lessthan what we are? Maybe a child's action is not appropriate, but thatdoesn't make the child "inappropriate".Somehow we have learned to vent out our anger not by expressing ourdispleasure over the action, but by blaming the other person. And since it'sthe other person's mistake we feel justified in doing so. You areirritating, you are disorganized, you are lazy, you are impulsive, you arecareless, and you are dishonest. All this doesn't leave much of self worth?

Alternate approach: When angry or upset, instead of shouting or hitting, tryexpressing your feelings by saying "I am upset that you told a lie". Thenexplicitly state what behavior you disapprove of, "I do not like lies beingtold" Follow that by clearly stating your expectations, "I trust you and Iexpect you to tell me the truth always"

4. Should

A large part of our critical self talk emerges from this thought processcalled SHOULD. "I should look good, I should answer right, I should besmart, I should not make a fool of myself by asking or trying" and so on.This happens because as a child our parents are constantly telling us whatSHOULD be done. This comes as a decree, a command. Hence it needs to beobeyed at all cost.

So we say to the child, "You should finish your homework fast". Now justassume that the child does not want to do so, or is not able to do so:either way, the child will keep saying inside himself, "I should, Ishould.."

Do a little exercise right now. Close your eyes and say to yourself (in atone or manner similar to how you say to yourself or to your children) "Ishould, .. I should, .. I should, .. I should, .. I should, ..". Check howdoes this makes you feel? Check if it is enlarging or diminishing?

Alternate approach: Replace all your SHOULDs with COULDs. "You could finishyour homework fast. You could say thank you to uncle" etc.

5. Decisions

One of the key sign of low self-esteem is consistent indecisiveness or theinability to take a balanced decision - result is either inaction orimpulsivity. This often stems from the fact that most of our childhooddecisions are taken by parents and many a times over-ridden by parents.Do you decide how much your child should eat? If your daughter chooses adress for a party - do you over ride her decision - especially with a "I sayso". We seem to have our own operating parameters, while child is ignorantof them, leaving the child in a lurch, she not really understanding what'swrong with her decision making.

A typical scene in a restaurant is when the child is asked what will you eatand when he expresses his decision it is overridden due to some reason.

If too many of the child's decisions are being taken or overridden, thechild is left with this very common self talk "I don't know what do to" or"I am not sure" leading to "I am not good enough".

Alternate approaches: First - let the child decide - the negativeconsequences arising from a wrong decision is only going to become alearning experience for the child. Secondly, if something is not acceptableto you - express that before the child makes the decision eg: "Choose yourdress, however, avoid a sleeveless one, as it is cold outside. Advance information empowers the child to make a sound decision. One the ways in which we cut negative self talk and build strong positiveself beliefs is through AFFIRMATIVE POSITIVE MESSAGES:" You are so lovable; You are capable; You are responsible; You enjoy learning; You are special; You are intelligent; You are an achiever " andso on.Look at all the negative messages children get as food between teeth - thesecan cause fatal decay (to the dignity of the child) - affirmative messagesconstantly floss their minds making their root thoughts (about themselves)stronger.

Another way to look at the whole concept of development of self belief is tofollow what 'Goethe' said:Correction does much, but encouragement does more

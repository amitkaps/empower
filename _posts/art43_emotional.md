Emotional Needs of a Child
==========================

The washing machine repair guy, the music system service center and my LCD projector service person all made the same remark. They said, in different words, that my "old" machine is really good, they don't make it like this (rugged and stable) any more. Today's machines require to be junked in just few years, while my old one is good for still many more years!

Later on, pondering over their statement frightened me. Is this true for machines only or true for humans, for children also. Aren't there more children or youths who commit suicides today; more numbers who are depressed and disillusioned; isn't stress and discontent increasing; and emotional burn outs common?

While almost all schools have included computers in their curriculum, why haven't they included emotional intelligence or EQ in their curriculum? (At best schools have appointed a school counselor - but that’s like having a doctor on call for all physically development. Why isn't emotional development a curriculum objective? While parents invest in all kinds of learning and developmental resources, why aren't their any EQ resources available? Do we as parents and teachers really understand a child's emotional needs? And more importantly what can we do - on a day to day basis.

Although one article is not enough to talk about all aspects of emotional development - here is a starter. 

We provide, in this article Geniekids five golden EQ principles:

1. The machine Principle: A machine is something which gives output to an input. Importantly the output is ONLY because of the INPUT. The emotional response a child shows (output) - anger, crying, hitting - is not the problem. The input - the reason for the emotional situation is what needs to be taken care. Somehow we as parents tend to respond to the emotional output - like “don't cry”, "you shouldn't hit" or "behave properly."Can we rather take care of the input by acknowledging the *real* issue - "you are upset because you want that toy", "you are mad with me for not playing with you" and so on... Take care of input and the child takes care of the output.

2. The Washing Machine principle: We realize emotional situation are just dirty linen. All it needs is - Add detergent - Soak - Churn. Our presence, listening and acceptance is the detergent. Now let’s give them time to become aware of what they are feeling (rather than what I as a parent is feeling and thinking). Once they come to understand their emotions, give them "space" to TRY out different strategies - the churning.

Example: Child comes home - I feel like hitting Rahul. I hate him. I am not playing with him anymore.

Parent: Okay.

Child: He is such a @#$%^

Parent: (instead of saying 'don't use such a language'), you seem to be really upset (acceptance - detergent)

Child: Yes, you know this Rahul..... (out pouring)

Parent: So what do you want to do (or how you would like me to help) - churn

3. The Music System principle: A player can only play the kind of media it is designed to play. A child will only express if he has learned how to express - from ME! If he has learnt FROM ME to shout, or shut up or blame or crib - then that’s the design of his system.

Hence it’s important that we express enough - our feelings - that we as adults do not sulk, or go into a shell or play everything is all right game.

Hence it’s important that we learn how to express so that child learns how to express our feelings. It is important that we use appropriate vocabulary so that child learns appropriate vocabulary.

So if you are upset with your maid, how do you express it to her! How do you deal with it? Think about it - work on it.

4. The Projector principle: It becomes clearer when we are able to project it. Help Children project their emotions. Use puppets, pretend play, soft toys, drawing, sand play, a big blackboard with colored chalks, poetry, songs and music, dance and drama and so on. Projections work as workable alternates to the conventionally unacceptable behaviors like hitting, shouting etc. Child also learns that having emotions is fine, it’s alright to be angry or upset or sad. The difference is in how you express it. When the child is exposed to a wider array of projection options - chances are she will use them!

5. Finally the Maintenance principle: A stitch in time saves nine. Don't run on a punctured tube, or you will end up spoiling the whole tyre. Something very frankly I am (ratnesh) still learning. Somewhere I tend to procrastinate an emotional problem hoping that it will go away. But garbage collected in your garbage can cannot be wished away. It needs to be emptied out. It needs to be allocated its time and effort.

Better is preventive maintenance - a kind of daily-lets-purge-our-emotional-bins kind of approach. An excellent idea is to do a lap before the nap. Just before putting children to sleep – each member goes through their day, specially touching upon the emotional – both positive or negative highs and lows. Remember we as parents need to do with our day, before we expect the child to do with their day. Realize this lap is not for discussion - just for expression. Another way is to have an emotional board - where everybody in the house can post "how am I feeling today" with the reassurance that this would be just accepted by everybody else.

Bholu the Baby Bear - Part 1

Bholu was a happy bear. But nowadays he was not so happy, as whenever he metdifferent animals, he wanted to be "like" them, be able to do things that theywere able to do. Once he called himself Bholu the rabbit and tried running andburrowing. He couldn't and this made him sad. The other day he called himselfBholu the fox, tried to sing like one but couldn't and this made him sad. Andthis went on ... till all this trying made Bholu very tired and unhappy.Fortunately papa and mama bear came to his rescue, assured him that he doesn'tneed to be *like anybody* and he can just be BHOLU. Armed with this newassurance, Bholu went around the forest telling all his friends that he is Bholuthe Bholu.

Bholu the Baby Bear - Part 2
But unfortunately the story does not end here. As Bholu started to grow further,his parents often told him things which Bholu could not really understand. Theytold him, at different times, that he should be well behaved or he should beintelligent or be smart or he should be bold and he should do well in studies,in competitions and he should perform well in his singing class and so on. They,at times, even pointed out to others and said he should be as confident asso-and-so and as friendly as so-and-so.

Not only his parents, but many other animals in the forest also told him similarthings. Giraffe aunty told him to walk erect, Deer uncle told him to be moreattentive and so on. Then came these advertisers into the jungle who put up bighoardings which told Bholu that only if he uses a particular brand of honey, heis likable; that only if he hangs around with a certain kind of animals, he canbe successful; only if he wears a certain kind of clothes can he be respectful -a complete bear!

Bholu was again sad. All this meant he should not he Bholu the Bholu, but Bholuthe something. Also, every time he did something, he would look around and see ifothers were watching him, and if they approved of him.

As Bholu grew further, he started becoming Bholu the *somebody*. He startedadding words and definitions to this *somebody*. Now he was (or wanted to be)Bholu the smart, intelligent, disciplined, well dressed, caring, loving,friendly .. (and many more) ... somebody.

This at times made him happy - when he was able to be that somebody. However,most of the times it only created a tension and made him unhappy. When somebodysaid something to him that did not confirm to this image he had made forhimself, it made him upset. He also became angry, irritable and he starteddefending or worse fighting. He made friends only with people who added to thisimage of his. He shunned and even looked down at people who did not add up tothis image.

Just like that, today, Cholu the Chimp remarked, "that was a foolish thing todo, Bholu". This made Bholu very upset ("How dare he call me a fool?") and hestarted shouting at Cholu. Fortunately wise old Uncle Bade was watching this.

In the evening, Uncle Bade called Bholu to his bed side and asked, "Bholu, whoare you"?"Well, uncle, I am a bear - just like you?", Bholu replied."And....", Uncle Bade encouraged Bholu to elaborate."I am a smart, intelligent, disciplined, Bear""And....", Uncle Bade encouraged him further."And I am well dressed, caring, loving, friendly ......""OK, this is fine." Uncle Bade paused Bholu. "Now tell me, right now you are notwell dressed, are you?""No"."So, right now, who are you, ""I am Bholu", came a confused reply."Also right now you are not sounding too intelligent. So, who are you?""I don't know", said a lost Bholu"Let me explain", assured Uncle Bade, "To me you are only Bholu the Bholu"."Bholu who is at times friendly and at times not, who is at times well dressedand at times not, who is at times well behaved and at times not. Who wouldremain Bholu even if he does something foolish, like you did with Cholu todaymorning.""Which means I am not all these things"?"No, to me the only image of Bholu that I have is your face. Other than thatthere is no image. There are no labels that I have put on Bholu.""But, aren't I supposed to be smart and bold.""Yes, your actions can be smart, or sometimes your behavior need not be. Butthat does not make you more or less."So what happens when I am not bold and I feel bad?"What happens when you scoop honey out of a comb and do not find it tasty?"I try another tree.""Does that make all honey bad?""No""Similarly when your actions are not bold or intelligent or friendly or so on (and others point it out to you) that does not make you *bad*."Bholu jumped and remarked, "I need to try again"."Yes, Bholu, so we learn from our actions - irrespective of it is bold or not -and then try again."Bholu was quite for a moment.

Uncle Bade asked, "So who is Bholu?""Bholu!" Bholu is only Bholu""Yes, the moment, Bholu has an image of himself, he would have limited learning.Rather he would busy defending, or at best trying to live upto that image".Bholu was now excited, "But if I do not have an image, I am Free to Learn!Yes, if you have no image of yourself, if you are only Bholu the Bholu, then youhave freedom to learn, freedom to be, freedom to express, freedom to understand,freedom to learn and freedom to GROW!

In part 3, we meet Uncle Bade again, as he meets Bholu's parents andanswer's their concerns, queries and suggest some strategies to unlock theirchild's potential to LEARN.

Bholu the Baby Bear - Part 3

One day Bholu (the bear) told his parents, "Once I grow up, I want to be aNOBODY"
His worried parents, asked, "Why?"

Because the other day Mr Parrot was very upset with the mango tree which has nofruit this year. He said to him, "What's the use of being a mango tree if youcan't give mangoes".
"But it would give mangoes next year?" Assured father bear.
"And what if it doesn't?" joined in Uncle Bade in the discussion
'Yes", said an excited Bholu, "What if it never able to bear mango fruits, everagain?"
"But what's that got to do with your being a nobody?”, Quizzed father bear.

Uncle Bade clarified, "Somehow we tend to get locked up in two things - first,our assumed roles and second, expectations we think people have from us. Oftenthe second emanating from the first. Which means we operate from outside.”But if”, as Bholu says, “we are nobody, then having nothing to prove, we simplylook at our strengths. Hence, we operate from inside - our strengths, which canbe constantly evolving. The same mango tree can then be a source of wood, orshelter or nesting sites and so on.”

”But we do need to be somebody, don't we, to be able to operate well in life, tobe able to achieve?”, piped in Mummy bear.

"Let me give an example," Replied Uncle Bade, "If Bholu and both of you, thinkthat he is very good in Math, and if by chance he gets less marks in a test-then Bholu feels disappointed. He may then work harder or he could resort toother means to somehow score better, or he may tell you lies and so on. Thereason for disappointment is not less score in the test, but the score shouldmatch up to the image that Bholu carries.”

”But what if, Bholu and both of you just think that Bholu likes and enjoys Math.Then even if he gets less score, without any disappointment, he simply wants todo the sums again or learn another way to solve them and so on.”

"Then it also doesn't matter how much my friend Chimpu gets", Adds Bholu
Liking and enjoying are in the "present state" and hence more about the task andless about the person. While tags like "good at", being "future" oriented aremore about the person and hence the struggle to live upto the image.

So you mean, to ensure effective learning, lets focus on the task as separatefrom the person.

Oh yes, you have hit the nail on the head. We call this as PROCESS basedlearning, where the process of learning is far more important than the result.Realize that the process is about the task - the interaction between the learnerand the learning while the result is about the person - the ability of learnerto produce the desired end.

Now Bholu was very excited, "Uncle Bade, is it same as how you said that I wasneither “creative”, nor “not creative’. I am simply someone who uses creativity sometimes and does not use it other times"

"Exactly! The moment I think creativity is about me or the results I produce,there are three problems:One, on the basis of my results, I start evaluating myself as 'creative' or 'not creative'. If I judge myself to be 'not creative', I am unnecessarily putting aserious limitation on myself. If I judge, I am creative, and if others assessany of my work as "not creative" - I get hurt and either fret or fight or both!Two, I spend too much time trying to get others to see me the way I thinkthey should see me, while, I would be better off focusing on the task itself.Three, and most important of all, instead of open to others comments asfeedback, I usually defend it as a criticism and hence am mostly closed to learning.

"The image becomes the result we want to fuel". Father Bholu now understood,

"Exactly, if we focus on the process of creativity and enjoy it, we learn more,grow more and achieve more.

”But this way won't we all take more time to learn?”, Mother Bear worried.

”But mummy, since I am nobody, I am not in a hurry to be somebody”, argued Bholu.

”I get it. Time becomes a pressure only if we are trying to prove the personbehind it, rather then the learning behind it", replied clearer mummy bear.

”I think we all are much clearer about this "image" which blocks the process andforces us to focus on the results. But true freedom to learn is in realizingthat the result is binding, while process is liberating.”, said Uncle Bade

Meet me, I am Bholu the Bear, a nobody, who doesn't try to be somebody, just enjoys learning everything and from everybody.

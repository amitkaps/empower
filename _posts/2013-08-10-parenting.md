Whenever you think, do you think in terms of questions or in terms of statements? Have you ever asked a question without first thinking for possible answers? When somebody tells you something, its possible to ignore it. But when somebody asks you a question, can your mind ignore thinking about it? Why is this so?

Ladies and Gentleman, Mothers and Fathers, presenting the ultimate panacea,the ultimate disciplining, learning and teaching tool, an amazing language that leads to higher intelligence. A language common to all great thinkers and leaders, from Socrates to Einstein.

Chuck out the useless “T” language – tell them, tell them, tell them, and then wonder why they don’t get it! Tune in to the new “Q” language – ask them, let them ponder, decide, answer and you would wonder why you didn’t do more of this before.

Child doesn’t go to sleep easily: Try asking questions, “Why do you think it’s important to take a nap? How will you benefit from a good sleep? What can you (or I) do so that you can sleep easily?”

Child doesn’t wash hands before eating: Try Asking questions, “Why do you think we should wash hands before eating? How will this help you? Do we need to wash it everyday? Why?”

Child insists on watching too much TV: Try asking questions, “What do you want to become in life? How will you become that? What all you need to do for that? How much will TV help in that? What else you need to do that will help you?”

Child gets low marks in a test: Try asking questions, “What areas of your performance are you most pleased with? In what ways are you looking forward to enhancing your performance during the next test or month or year? What kind of help do you need?”

Child plays with dangerous things - plug points, knifes, glass items etc: Try asking questions, "Why do we prohibit you from playing with this? In what way can these things hurt you? Have you seen anybody getting hurt by these? By what age will you be able to use it?"

Child doesn’t do homework on time: Try asking questions, “How can we make homework interesting? What will happen/ what all we can do, if we finish homework fast? Why is homework important? How will this homework help you?

Child doesn’t understand a portion: Try asking questions, "What have you understood? What does it look similar to, different from? Which part was easy for you to get? Will you like to understand this yourself? Are you sure you need (my) help?"

Obviously rhetorical questions like "who did this?" "Why can't you improve?", "how can you get marks like this?" are too negative to yield any results.

We are talking of questions that make the child think. Hence we need to take judgment out of questions, make them non-threatening, and make them positive. The idea is not to judge the child's knowledge or intelligence by the answer.The idea is to let the intelligence and knowledge grow by self-exploration.

Why are questions so magical in disciplining, in learning, in developing overall intelligence?

They make children think.

The children own the answers – so they may follow it through (The answers may not match with your expectations, but still they are their answers). Be careful not to immediately correct them. Let this discovery be their own. It’s best when they realize and come and tell you “You know mummy you were right or I was wrong" etc.

Questions mean possibilities, choices and that is much more interesting than commands!

Questions help clear conflicts by giving the child a voice of his or her own. It thrills them that they are heard.

They not only own the choice, they own the consequence.

They learn to think creatively, values take ground, concepts get clear.

Questions don’t focus on mistakes; they look forward, not backwards. You have to avoid “Why” questions.

Any thinking they do, further stimulates the brain to think, to become alive.That is a good feeling, which usually multiplies.

It makes them the teller, and you the listener.

IT IS SO SIMPLE TO DO.

Under "Genie Worth-it" below we provide a string of questions that can actually change the whole atmosphere (and your relationship) in your home. Try them.

Also when the child finally answers the question by “I don’t know" – chances are the child has opened a window for you to provide an answer. Let’s not be greedy here – so keep the answer short 

A good question is never answered. It is not a bolt to be tightened into place but a seed to be planted and to bear more seeds towards the hope of greening the landscape of mind.” (John Ciardi)

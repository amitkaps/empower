Dear parents - the following article is based on a real conversation. Do see if it rings some bells for you?

How to discover True Potential

She said, "My six year old is quite shy. Even if another child is hurtinghim - he won't say anything? Yesterday in school somebody ate his snacks -and he came back home hungry. What do I do?”

I replied (familiar with this most oft quoted issue), "Ask him questions"
"Questions!" retorted mother visibly dismayed, "What kind of questions?”

For example, I said, "I may ask him after he came home hungry, What did youlearn from this experience?"

Now she was definitely confused, "What do you think he will answer?"

"I don't know, and to me it doesn't matter what he answers. But whatmatters, is that I have made him think?” I said.

"But just by thinking will it solve his problem?"

"Not in one day, not in one instance - but if we keep asking him meaningfulquestions - surely he will develop his own way, his own style - of beingconfident, assertive and self-reliant individual. Isn't that discoveringchild own true potential?"

Mother was quite for a long time, then said "Is a six year old capableof...."

I cut her off, "Even a two year old is capable, provided we are ready togive him time, provided we continuously give them opportunities, to try, tomake mistake, to fail, to succeed, and to try again and so on". Provided weare with the child, in his trials and tribulations, in his efforts,howsoever wrong or insignificant these look to us"

Still full of doubt, she murmured, "Will this work?""What are the options?" I asked. "Did you try telling, teaching, preachinghim? Did that work? What questions do is that they force the child to think- the only way in which we learn. Once we get the process going - then thereis no limit to learning.”

"More importantly the child learns how to learn - he then relies on his ownintelligence, resourcefulness and ingenuity to pave his own path through thethicket of problems and conflicts and dilemmas that life anyway has to offer- now and in future."

"While I get your idea, I am still wondering about the age factor", themother persisted.

Then you must visit our center - where whether its two year old in the pre-school <<http://www.geniekids.com/khoj> program or a five yearold in the daily afternoon program<http://www.geniekids.com/yc > or an eight year old in SuccessSaturday <http://www.geniekids.com/ss> program or even anadult learning <http://www.geniekids.com/ttt>about the ways of a child - each is forced to think there own way - and eachof them basks in the glory of their own solutions, whether they are tryingto learn social skills or language or math or emotional skills........

"Give me more examples of questions that one could ask," now the mother wasexcited.

”Why eight laws'?" was her immediate puzzled response.
"Because when you put them all together and get them to work in unison witheach other - then in some ways you are guaranteed a successful child anddownstream parenting""Downstream parenting - thats a new term?"

"Most of us at some time or the other are struggling, simply because we aretrying to change the child - that’s swimming against the flow - but once wealign our efforts to a child's natural way of working and growing its muchless effort."

”Okay”, said the mother, “but you also promised me some more examples ofquestions?”

Yes, here are some of the learning questions we constantly ask:(Do also look at details of our programs given below the questions - whereasking these kind of questions is the staple way a child learns)

What do you feel are your greatest attributes/ strengths?
What do you think we should do?
In what ways could I be most helpful to you right now?
How do you think you'll feel if you do that?
What will likely happen if you do that? Are those the results youwant most?
How do you think so-end-so will feel if you do that?
In What other ways could we solve this problem?
What do you need to do to get where you would like to be?
How can you do this better? Why would you like to do this better?Why was doing this work excellently so important to you?
What do you like in your friends? Would you like to have all thosepositive qualities in you? How will you develop them?
In what ways will you like to be different to your father/ mother? Inwhat ways similar?
How can you achieve something today that you will be proud of? Whatwill that be? What did you achieve today that you are proud of?
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN THEN? {this can be asked as a follow-upto any string of questions for us far out into time as the child canconceive at his age.}

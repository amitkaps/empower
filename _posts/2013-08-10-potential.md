Dear parents - the following article is based on a real conversation. Do see if it rings some bells for you?

How to discover True Potential

She said, "My six year old is quite shy. Even if another child is hurting him - he won't say anything. Yesterday in school somebody ate his snacks, and he came back home hungry. What do I do?”

I replied (familiar with this most oft quoted issue), "Ask him questions"
"Questions!" retorted mother visibly dismayed, "What kind of questions?”

For example, I said, "I may ask him after he came home hungry, what did you learn from this experience?"

Now she was definitely confused, "What do you think he will answer?"

"I don't know, and to me it doesn't matter what he answers. But what matters, is that I have made him think?” I said.

"But just by thinking will it solve his problem?"

"Not in one day, not in one instance - but if we keep asking him meaningful questions - surely he will develop his own way, his own style - of being confident, assertive and self-reliant individual. Isn't that discovering child's own true potential?"

Mother was quite for a long time, then said "Is a six year old capable of...."

I cut her off, "Even a two year old is capable, provided we are ready to give him time, provided we continuously give them opportunities, to try, to  make mistakes, to fail, to succeed, and to try again and so on". Provided we are with the child, in his trials and tribulations, in his efforts, howsoever wrong or insignificant these look to us"

Still full of doubt, she murmured, "Will this work?" "What are the options?" I asked. "Did you try telling, teaching, preaching him? Did that work? What questions do is that they force the child to think- the only way in which we learn. Once we get the process going - then there is no limit to learning.”

"More importantly the child learns how to learn - he then relies on his own intelligence, resourcefulness and ingenuity to pave his own path through the thicket of problems and conflicts and dilemmas that life anyway has to offer - now and in future."

"While I get your idea, I am still wondering about the age factor", the mother persisted.

Then you must visit our center - where whether its two year old in the pre-school program or an eight year old in Success program even an adult learning about the ways of a child - each is forced to think their own way - and each of them basks in the glory of their own solutions, whether they are trying to learn social skills or language or math or emotional skills........

"Give me more examples of questions that one could ask," now the mother was excited.

"First you have to stop doing UpStream parenting"
"UpStream parenting - that's a new term?"

"Most of us at some time or the other are struggling, simply because we are trying to change the child - that’s swimming against the flow - but once we align our efforts to a child's natural way of working and growing, its much less effort."

”Okay”, said the mother, “but you also promised me some more examples of questions?”

Yes, here are some of the learning questions we constantly ask:

"What do you think we should do? and this question followed by questions like
What will likely happen if you do that? Are those the results you want most?
In What other ways could we solve this problem?
What do you need to do to get where you would like to be?
How can you do this better? Why would you like to do this better? Why was doing this work excellently so important to you?
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN THEN? {this can be asked as a follow-up to any string of questions for as far out into time as the child can conceive at his age.}

The mother was thinking, "I see the value of the questions - just not sure how the child will reply?"
"The key idea is not the answer", I clarified to her, "It is the question itself. In fact we are not asking to listen to an answer - we are asking so that the child can think - right now, little later, and even much later".

Just as I would like you to think about what all we discussed today - when, what and how much you think is your choice. In any case you explore your potential as a parent!

Ha, Ha, Ha ... our meeting ended amidst some laughter and loads of thoughts.
